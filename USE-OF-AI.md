# Enhancing Our Project with AI Assistive Tools

In this project, we integrated AI assistive tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to enhance our development and analytical processes. This document describes the specific uses of these tools, the tasks they assisted with, and the most effective ways to leverage their capabilities.

## How AI Assistive Tools Helped Us

These AI tools significantly improved our efficiency and effectiveness by automating routine tasks and providing on-demand assistance, allowing us to focus on more complex project challenges.

## Using GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot served as an on-the-fly coding assistant throughout the project. It provided real-time code suggestions and snippets as we developed scripts for data processing, feature extraction, and model training. This was particularly beneficial for quickly writing boilerplate code and standard data handling routines, speeding up the development cycle.

## Using ChatGPT

ChatGPT was employed primarily for two purposes: troubleshooting and generating documentation. Whenever we encountered bugs or implementation issues, we described the problem to ChatGPT, which often suggested effective solutions or pointed out errors in our logic. Additionally, ChatGPT assisted in drafting sections of our project documentation and reports, helping to articulate complex ideas and methodologies clearly and concisely.

## What Works Best When Using AI Assistive Tools

To get the most from these tools, we found that specific, well-formulated questions yielded the most useful responses. For troubleshooting with ChatGPT, providing detailed descriptions of the issue along with the context of the code snippet allowed us to receive more accurate solutions. With GitHub Copilot, starting with a clear comment describing the desired functionality prompted more relevant code suggestions.

## Summary

Utilizing AI assistive tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT has greatly improved the workflow and productivity of our project. GitHub Copilot enhanced our coding efficiency, particularly for routine tasks, while ChatGPT was invaluable for debugging and documentation. These tools have become integral to our development process, enabling faster problem-solving and more effective communication of complex project details.
